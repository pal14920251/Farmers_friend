# 🌾 AI-Powered Agricultural Decision Support System

*A multilingual, accessible AI tool for crop recommendation, irrigation planning, and plant disease detection.*

---

## 📌 Overview

Small and marginal farmers across India often lack access to reliable, localized, and scientific agricultural guidance. Many existing tools are either too generic or too complex, making them inaccessible to low-literacy and low-connectivity regions.

This project builds a **lightweight, multilingual AI decision-support system** that helps farmers make data-driven choices about:

* **Which crop to grow**
* **What irrigation method to use**
* **What disease is affecting their plant**

All recommendations are generated using **machine learning, computer vision, weather APIs, rule-based agronomic logic**, and a **guided user interface**, ensuring ease of use.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Provide *localized, trustworthy* crop and irrigation advice.
* Enable *early disease detection* using computer vision.
* Build a *simple, multilingual UI* that works for real-world Indian farming conditions.
* Integrate AI with *soil health card values, real-time weather data*, and farmer inputs.

## 🧱 System Architecture

The system integrates multiple AI modules into a unified workflow:

### 1. **Crop Recommendation Model**

* **Dataset:** Kaggle Crop Recommendation Dataset
* **Model:** Decision Tree Classifier
* **Features:**

  * N, P, K
  * pH
  * Temperature
  * Humidity
  * Rainfall
* **Weather data** (temperature, humidity, rainfall) fetched using **OpenWeatherMap API**.

### 2. **Soil-Type Identification**

* District → soil-zone mapping
* Soil type automatically retrieved based on user-selected district
* Soil type feeds into irrigation logic

### 3. **Irrigation Recommendation Engine**

A rule-based engine informed by agricultural domain knowledge:

* Sandy soil + low rainfall → **Drip irrigation**
* Clay soil + moderate rainfall → **Furrow/Flood irrigation**
* High water-demand crop + adequate rainfall → **Sprinkler**

Irrigation = *function(crop, soil_type, rainfall)*

### 4. **Plant Disease Detection (Computer Vision)**

* **Dataset:** PlantVillage (with basic augmentations)
* **Model:** Transfer-learning using **ResNet-50**, modified with:

  * Pretrained ImageNet backbone
  * Final FC layer replaced with `Linear(2048 → num_classes)`
* **Preprocessing:**

  * Resize → Center-crop (224×224)
  * Normalize (ImageNet mean/std)
  * Random flips & rotations
* **Training Details:**

  * Loss: Cross-Entropy
  * Optimizer: Adam
  * LR Scheduler: StepLR / ReduceLROnPlateau
* **Inference:**

  * Farmer uploads a leaf image → Model outputs the predicted disease class.


### 5. **LLM-Based Expert Explanation Layer**

* Aggregates:

  * Crop recommendation
  * Soil type
  * Irrigation strategy
  * Disease diagnosis
* Generates a natural, unified agricultural advisory.

### 6. **Multilingual Translation (Bhashini)**

* Converts final output to any Indian language selected by the farmer.
* English responses bypass translation.

## 🔄 End-to-End Workflow

1. User selects **language** and **district**.
2. Enters **soil nutrient values** (N, P, K, pH).
3. System fetches **weather** via API.
4. Crop Recommendation Model predicts best crop.
5. Soil type is auto-selected based on district.
6. Irrigation engine recommends suitable method.
7. (Optional) User uploads a leaf image → Disease detection model predicts disease.
8. LLM synthesizes a unified advisory.
9. Bhashini translates it to the selected language.
10. Final output shown to the user.
