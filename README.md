# Farmers_friend
This project builds a simple, multilingual AI tool for Indian farmers that recommends suitable crops, irrigation methods, and detects plant diseases using ML and computer vision. It integrates soil data, weather APIs, leaf-image diagnosis, and LLM-based guidance to deliver accessible, localized agricultural support.
